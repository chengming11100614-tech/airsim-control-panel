# AirSim Mission Control Panel

Python 3.10 control panel for the Africa AirSim scene. It includes route planning, ordered waypoint flight, manual controls, telemetry logging, and flight training tools.

The route planner and automatic cruise controller are being upgraded for safe, time-aware racing over a fixed waypoint order. Obstacles are manually drawn circular cylinders in the XY plane; waypoint altitude uses AirSim NED coordinates.

## Run

```powershell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Start the AirSim scene first, then connect from the panel. The simulator runs on the configured AirSim RPC endpoint (default `127.0.0.1:41451`).

## Structure

- `main.py`: Tkinter application entry and panel wiring.
- `planner/`: geometric route and trajectory planning.
- `flight/`: standalone flight training exercises and CSV recording.

Flight logs, local simulator settings, and Python environments are excluded from Git.
